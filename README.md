> Note that this is still in development.

## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

Clone this repository then install the dependencies using `npm install`.

### Scripts

Use `run` to start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```


Use `build` to create a production version of your app.

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
